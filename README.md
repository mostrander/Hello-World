# Hello-World
First repository

Hello! My name is Megan Ostrander and I am an aspiring program developer. 

I am currently learning how to create programs with the C# programming language. I find it easy to understand and I greatly enjoy using the language. I intend to learn several other programming languages, such as: F#, Java, C++, and Python. It is my intention to obtain a good basis of programming knowledge so I can get a programming job, then I will pursue additional education to further my knowledge.
